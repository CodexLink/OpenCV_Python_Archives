    # In this script, we're not worrying about the aspect ratio when it comes to image resizing.
    * The focus of image resizing here is for the use of interpolation.

    ! So far, in OpenCV we have three best-known available interpolations for image resizing and those are:
    * (1) INTER_LINEAR — Default Option for Image Enlargement. Faster than Cubic, Primarily Used when zooming is required.
    * (2) INTER_AREA — Specifically used for Image Shrinking. Technically an interpolation for using best representative pixel to ensure quality is not worse upon shrink.
    * (3) INTER_CUBIC — A Complex Computated Interpolation for Image Enlargement. Slower than Linear, but the quality is better.

    * Meanwhile, there are other known Interpolators as well. But its not that well known or used as far as I cant tell.
    * (1) INTER_NEAREST — a nearest-neighbor interpolation, might be used for image shrinking because it base on near-pixel of the selected pixel.
    * (2) INTER_LANCZOS4  — a Lanczos interpolation over 8×8 pixel neighborhood. Potentially usable for pixel-candidate for image shrinking and enlargement.

    For now, only INTER_LINEAR, INTER_AREA, and INTER_CUBIC will be introduced for now.
