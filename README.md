## Installation

In this section, you will learn how to get up and running with the scripts for each folders.

### Pre-requisites

Before you start, you should have the following:

1. **Python 3.8 x64** in your system.
2. Has `poetry` package installed in your python.
3. Any IDE with Integrated Terminal, just like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

> Be aware that `virtualenvs` of poetry is not detected by default by Visual Studio Code. Please refer to the [StackOverflow Issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59882884/vscode-doesnt-show-poetry-virtualenvs-in-select-interpreter-option) or [Github Issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python/issues/8372).

### Instructions

1. **Clone** (*If you want to only have a copy of this repo*) or **Fork** (*If you want to commit your own changes*) this repository.
2. Open the repository folder in your IDE or path your Terminal / Command Prompt to the repository folder that you just cloned / forked.
3. Type the following:

    ```text
        poetry install
        poetry run env python
        poetry shell

    ```

    In poetry, if you `poetry install`, all of the `--dev` and `--main` dependencies will be **installed**. If you don't want linting and formatting that is in `dev-dependencies`.
    You might wanna opt-out by installing it in a way as this:

    > poetry install --no-dev

4. Choose any **entrypoint script** file and run it.
